A Bluesky client made using Flutter, design to be lightweight and easy to use.

**WIP**: For now, this project is very barebones, don't expect a full client.

## Installation
You will need flutter, it is tested for the "stable" version.

### Linux
You will need `libmpv` for handling video playback.

## TODO
* Better search
* Feeds (all, not only pinned by user)
* Notifications
* Allow adding media in posts
* Allow swipe up to refresh list of items
* Add documentation
* Make tests
* Use SecureStorage for session data
